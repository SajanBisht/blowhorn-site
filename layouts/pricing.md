## Our refund promise

On your first purchase you have 14 days to ask for a refund. If you haven't posted through Blowhorn yet, you get all of it back. If you have, we keep one month at the monthly price and refund the rest. After 14 days there are no cash refunds: your plan keeps working to the end of the year you paid for, then your account moves to Free.
