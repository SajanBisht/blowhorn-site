# Authoring template - copy this file into a category folder
# (for example getting-started/my-video.md), fill in every field, and
# set draft to false. This file itself is a draft and never publishes.
#
# Required front matter:
#   title        - the video's name, shown on cards and the video page.
#   description  - one or two sentences; used on cards, search and feeds.
#   date         - publication date (YYYY-MM-DD). Our model requires one
#                  (the layer5io/docs model this is based on has none;
#                  our feeds and recency sorting need it).
#   layout       - always "video".
#   videoType    - "local" for a file the site hosts itself. "youtube"
#                  is reserved: the first embedded video ships with a
#                  privacy-page update, per the site's third-party rule.
#   duration     - "m:ss", shown on the card.
#   categories   - the display name of the category folder the file
#                  lives in. The folder is the category; keep them equal.
#   tags         - lowercase slugs; they become /tags/<tag>/ pages and
#                  the tag filter chips. Reuse existing tags first.
#   video        - mp4 and webm paths under assets/video/, and a poster
#                  image (16:9) - the card and the player facade.
# Optional:
#   featured     - true puts the video at the top of the videos landing.
#                  One featured video at a time.

Replace this body with anything the video page should add under the player: notes, links, a transcript.
