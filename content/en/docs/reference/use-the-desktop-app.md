What each part of the Blowhorn desktop app shows and does. This page
describes; the steps live in the how-to guides linked under Related.

## The menu bar and the popover

Blowhorn lives in the menu bar. Opening it shows the popover, which has
two boards. The running board shows the scheduler, what is due now, what
is running, what needs you, and the content queue with a countdown to
the next tick. The paused board shows PAUSED with each tick-level pause
scope stated once, and the rows that would post now wait instead of
posting. A store outage puts its line above the board.

The popover footer holds the pause controls and, when an update is
ready, the update card. The update downloads the new version, checks it
against the release's checksums, confirms it is signed by the same Apple
Developer ID team as the running app and accepted by Gatekeeper, installs it
and relaunches the app; when it cannot, it opens the release page in your
browser. An installed Blowhorn that finds such a release when it opens also
asks in the console window, before the download, with **Download**, **Later**
and a **?** help icon;
what each does is under [Update](/docs/how-to/set-up/install-the-app/#update).

## The console

The console is the full window, reached from the popover. Its rail, in
order: "home", "jobs", "content", "runs", "profiles", "analytics",
"background", "settings". Each screen reads live state on open. Nothing here edits on
a timer. Until you're signed in and the extension is ready, every rail item
but "home" is locked; see
[Set up Blowhorn the first time](/docs/how-to/set-up/first-run-setup/).

| Screen | Shows | Acts |
|---|---|---|
| home | Whether Blowhorn is working, what runs next, and whether it needs you; a pause names which pause holds - this Mac, all Macs, or both | Resume the pause it names (one button per pause while both hold); reconnect an account; finish setting up |
| jobs | Every schedule row, whether it is due, paused, or held; a job drawer with the row behind it; a bootstrap preview for a starter set | Create, edit, pause or resume one row; run one row now; apply the bootstrap set |
| content | The queue: pending rows, rows still owed to some profile, clicked-but-unread rows | Edit a row; clearing a clicked row's "Date Promoted" re-queues it |
| runs | Past runs with their ledger lines; per-job logs under the log directory's `scheduler/` folder | Re-run a failure from its row |
| profiles | Every profile, its Chrome mapping, its per-platform sessions | Add a profile; map or unmap its Chrome profile |
| analytics | Followers, growth, and operations per profile; collection freshness in the header | Collect now; open the HTML report |
| background | Who registered the background service, whether it runs, the last tick heartbeat, the pause for all machines | Check now; pause or resume all machines; open System Settings when the service is turned off there |
| settings | Engine defaults rendered from the CLI's own option list, the extension card, your account card | Change defaults, check the extension, choose its mode, test your account connection |

The jobs table keeps every value on one line. When the list is narrow -
the drawer is wide, or the window is small - the driver and recurrence
columns leave first (the drawer still shows both) and a long profile list
is shortened with an ellipsis; the status is never cut.

The analytics screen states how fresh its numbers are in the header and
has no refresh control of its own. Its operations heatmap has one row per
profile; runs recorded for several profiles at once (`all`, or a comma
list) name no one profile, so they are counted beside it rather than shown
as a row. The runs screen reaches per-job logs through the log directory
listing, which includes each capture file and its rollover. The background
screen is the visible face of `blowhorn service`: it reports the service
the app registered and never installs, updates or uninstalls one.

Profiles made before profile names were lowercase keep their capitalised
folder (`data/profiles/Lee`). The app lists them as they are spelled and
reads and saves them as the lowercase name every command resolves them to.

## Setup

Setup is the engine checklist the app opens on while its engine is not
ready (otherwise the first run is the guided setup; see
[Set up Blowhorn the first time](/docs/how-to/set-up/first-run-setup/)),
five rows read from this machine:
"Blowhorn folder", "helper tools", "organization connection", "chrome profiles",
and "background service". The first two check the engine bundled in the
app, or a contributor's checkout when the app uses one
([Install the app](/docs/how-to/set-up/install-the-app/#first-run)); the
engine in the app never needs a clone or an install, so its rows offer
neither. An app run from its disk image says to move it to Applications
instead. Each row reports ok, warn, or off with the
one fix that clears it. The "map chrome profiles" panel and the
"background service" row act directly: mapping a profile and
registering the service happen here, not in a terminal.

## Settings

Settings edits the same `.blowhorn.yaml` defaults the CLI reads: pace,
excluded profiles, dry run, notifications, logs, and the Chrome launch
mode. The engine-defaults card renders from `blowhorn config show`,
so the app can never offer an option the engine does not know. The
extension card reports whether the extension is installed, which
version answers, and whether it says connected, and sets its
[extension mode](/docs/reference/chrome/#extension-mode-classic-or-background), classic or
background, on your Layer5 Cloud account. **guided setup** at the
bottom reopens the first-run setup, and **run setup again** opens Setup.
Quitting the app leaves
posting to the background service and the keep-running setting; see
[What runs when the app is closed](/docs/explanation/distribution/).
