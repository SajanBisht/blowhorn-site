Blowhorn works on Slack through Slack's API, never the browser, and sends as you. It uses a Slack token in your account (`SLACK_USER_TOKEN` or `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`) or your Slack session, linked through the Blowhorn extension in Google Chrome.

Sends a message as you to a channel, a person, or a thread. One
profile sends. `blowhorn post --platform slack --message` sends one
ad-hoc message with no queue activity.

## Supported actions

{{< supported-actions "slack" >}}

## Slack messages

Send from a queue activity or ad hoc. An activity sends to its own target; `--message`
with `--target` sends one message you type, with no activity read or marked
done, and `--target` redirects the run's queued Slack activities. The target
is a `#channel`, `@user`, channel id, channel link, or message link for
a thread reply; anything else is refused, never sent somewhere else.
One profile sends a `post` run, named with `--profile`; the profile from
the defaults file does not count as named. `blowhorn slack send` can send
as several profiles (`--profile rian,alex`); see the [CLI reference](/docs/reference/cli/).

## From the command line

[`blowhorn slack`](/docs/reference/cli/slack/) has six verbs: `send`, `edit`, `delete`,
`react`, `whoami` and `profiles`. Each write is a dry run until `--confirm`, and
`edit` and `delete` change only a message that profile sent with Blowhorn. For
an AI agent, [`blowhorn-axi`](/docs/reference/cli/blowhorn-axi/) wraps the same writes:
your own session only, compact output with the next commands to run, and no
Slack reads.
