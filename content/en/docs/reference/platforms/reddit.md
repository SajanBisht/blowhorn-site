# Reddit

Blowhorn works on Reddit in your own signed-in Chrome, through the Blowhorn extension. Sign in to Reddit there once, by hand. The credential Blowhorn checks is `RDDT_USERNAME`.

## Supported actions

{{< supported-actions "reddit" >}}

Posts to the subreddit the row's "Destination" names as `r/<name>`; with
no subreddit the row is skipped, never guessed. Comments when "Comment
on" holds a Reddit post or comment address. Amplifies with an upvote.

## Reddit posts and comments

Posting needs the subreddit in "Destination" or, for an upvote, in
"Amplify". Commenting needs a Reddit address in "Comment on" plus a
"Message Text". Both `post` and `comment` act on comment rows; a row
already marked done is never acted on twice.
