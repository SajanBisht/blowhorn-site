What Blowhorn can do on each platform, how it reaches
each one, and the limits it honors. This page describes; the steps live
in the how-to guides linked under Related.

Four platforms drive your own signed-in Google Chrome through the extension:
LinkedIn, X, Reddit, and Hacker News. Three post through their APIs
above the browser: Slack, Bluesky, and GitHub. A platform is usable the
moment its credential exists; see [Who can post as whom](/docs/explanation/eligibility/).

`blowhorn post --platform` accepts one of: `linkedin`, `x`, `reddit`,
`hn`, `slack`, `bluesky`, `github`, or `all`. `twitter` reads as `x`
and `bsky` as `bluesky`. GitHub is amplify-only under `post`: it needs
an issue or pull-request URL and refuses without one.

Each platform has its own page, listing its supported actions and how each one behaves there:

</div>

YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook are coming soon. None of them
is generally available yet, `blowhorn post --platform` does not list
them, and each page will list its actions once it ships.

## Limits

Every platform and action has a built-in daily ceiling, enforced per
profile from the run ledger in your account, so a cap holds on every
computer that shares the account; each platform's page carries its
numbers. A Risk Profile preset may take only a share of a ceiling, and
you can set a lower daily cap of your own per platform and action --
`defaults.caps` for every profile, or one profile's `Daily Caps`
attribute -- but never a higher one. See
[Daily caps](/docs/reference/configuration/#daily-caps).
