Blowhorn works on Bluesky through Bluesky's API, never the browser. It uses `BLUESKY_HANDLE` with `BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD`, kept in the profile's credential in your account: an app password, not your main password.

Posts up to 300 characters per post; longer messages split into
threads. Reposts for amplify activities. Follows with `blowhorn follow`,
unfollows one account with `blowhorn unfollow`, searches posts with
`blowhorn find`. Analytics appends a follower and following trend activity
per run.

Bluesky publishes a limit of 1,666 records an hour and 11,666 a day per
account, every post, like, repost, reply and follow counted together.
Blowhorn counts them together too and never goes past it
([the one hard stop](/docs/how-to/settings/choose-your-rules-of-engagement/#a-limit-the-platform-publishes-is-the-one-hard-stop)).
