What your computer needs before you install Blowhorn. Requires macOS 13
or newer and Google Chrome 142 or newer.

| Need | Requirement | Checked by |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | 13 or newer, Apple silicon or Intel (one universal build) | The build declares the floor; Setup checks the rest |
| Google Chrome | 142 or newer, the real Google Chrome (not Chromium), installed and signed in | Setup, "chrome profiles" row; `blowhorn chrome status` |
| Engine | Bundled in the app, with its own Python; nothing to install | Setup, "Blowhorn folder" and "helper tools" rows |
| Account | A Blowhorn account your profile belongs to | Setup, "organization connection" row; `blowhorn store` |
| Background runs | The background service, registered from the app | Setup, "this computer on watch" row |

macOS 13 is the floor the desktop build declares
(`minimumSystemVersion: 13.0`), and every release is one universal DMG
(`Blowhorn-<version>-universal.dmg`) for Apple silicon and Intel Macs.
The engine underneath also runs on Linux; the desktop app needs a Mac.
Windows is not supported.

Use the real Google Chrome, not Chromium and not a headless
build. Blowhorn drives the Chrome profiles you already use, so install
Google Chrome the normal way and sign in before you map anything. The extension
needs Chrome profiles to attach to; without Chrome every browser run
refuses before it acts.

The app carries its engine and Python, so your computer needs no git and no
Python. A contributor running the engine from a checkout instead needs
Python 3.14, the floor `tools/install.sh` enforces and the only supported
version. Either way the Setup screen checks the engine, so a broken engine
or interpreter shows up there first, not mid-run.

Network access to your account is required for the content queue, the schedule, profiles, and run history. Your account keeps those in sync; your computer holds the app, the engine, and your Chrome sessions.
Offline behavior is a plans question, not a requirements one: see
[Plans and limits](/docs/reference/plans/).
