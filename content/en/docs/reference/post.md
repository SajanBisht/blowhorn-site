Publishes the queue's pending activities and amplifies existing content.
This page covers what the command reference cannot say: what counts
as pending, the one-click rule, and how posting behaves on each
platform. Every flag and example for the command is in
[`blowhorn post` in the CLI reference](/docs/reference/cli/post/); the steps live
in the how-to guides under Related.

## What "pending" means

An activity is pending when "Approved?" says `yes` or `true`, "Date Promoted"
is empty, "Promote On" is due or blank, and the profile and platform
resolve. `--check-queue` lists the pending activities without publishing
anything, opening no browser and hitting no API. `--dry-run` walks the
whole run, printing what would go out, and marks nothing done.

`--dry-run --payload-stdin` is a dry fire of one post that is not saved:
the post's values (the fields `content upsert` takes, naming one Profile and
one Platform) arrive as JSON on stdin and take the same dry run, printing
each stage as it is reached (`Dry fire · signin · signed in to LinkedIn`).
It writes nothing to your Blowhorn account - no post, routine, ledger entry
or run record - and `--json` ends with the result. Hacker News is refused,
because its dry run signs in. The app's New order uses it for **Dry fire**.

```bash
echo '{"Platform": "LinkedIn", "Profile": "kate", "Message Text": "Release day."}' \
  | blowhorn post --dry-run --payload-stdin --json
```

Posting is one click per run. A clicked control with no confirmation
read back is recorded as clicked, outcome not read, counted for
nothing, and never retried by the run. See
[How Blowhorn avoids repeat posts](/docs/explanation/never-twice/).

## Platform behavior

LinkedIn, X, Reddit, and Hacker News drive your Google Chrome through the
extension. Slack, Bluesky, and GitHub post through their APIs. Reddit
activities need their subreddit as `r/<name>` in "Destination" or "Amplify";
without one the activity is skipped. A "Comment on" activity addressed to a
LinkedIn or Reddit location becomes a comment under `post` as well as
under `comment`; X has no comment flow.

GitHub is amplify-only under `post`: `--platform github` needs an
`--amplify` issue or pull-request URL, or a GitHub activity's "Amplify"
column, and refuses without one.

### Tags

A tag is written in each platform's own form in that platform's "Message
Text", and is never placed on a guess:

| Platform | A tag is | What Blowhorn does |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | picked from LinkedIn's own list | Refuses any post, Page post, group post, repost with thoughts or comment whose text holds `@name`, naming the activity and the tag, before Chrome opens - a dry run too. Write the name without `@` to send it as plain text. |
| X | `@handle` | Types it as written. A tag that ends a line (only spaces or punctuation before the line break) is refused, because the line break could pick from X's suggestion list instead. A thread is never split inside a tag. |
| Bluesky | `@name.domain` | Looks each handle up before the first post goes out and sends the tag linked to that account. A handle that names no account refuses the activity, with nothing sent. |
| Reddit | `u/name` or `r/name` | Types it as written. |
| Slack | `<@U…>`, a member's id | Sends it as written. A plain `@name` is plain text. |

What each platform shows for a tag that went out has not been recorded yet.
