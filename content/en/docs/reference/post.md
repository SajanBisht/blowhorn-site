Publishes the queue's pending rows and amplifies existing content.
This page covers what the command reference cannot say: what counts
as pending, the one-click rule, and how posting behaves on each
platform. Every flag and example for the command is in
[`blowhorn post` in the CLI reference](/docs/reference/cli/post/); the steps live
in the how-to guides under Related.

## What "pending" means

A row is pending when "Approved?" says `yes` or `true`, "Date Promoted"
is empty, "Promote On" is due or blank, and the profile and platform
resolve. `--check-queue` lists the pending rows without publishing
anything, opening no browser and hitting no API. `--dry-run` walks the
whole run, printing what would go out, and marks nothing done.

Posting is one click per run. A clicked control with no confirmation
read back is recorded as clicked, outcome not read, counted for
nothing, and never retried by the run. See
[How Blowhorn avoids repeat posts](/docs/explanation/never-twice/).

## Platform behavior

LinkedIn, X, Reddit, and Hacker News drive your Chrome through the
extension. Slack, Bluesky, and GitHub post through their APIs. Reddit
rows need their subreddit as `r/<name>` in "Destination" or "Amplify";
without one the row is skipped. A "Comment on" row addressed to a
LinkedIn or Reddit location becomes a comment under `post` as well as
under `comment`; X has no comment flow.

GitHub is amplify-only under `post`: `--platform github` needs an
`--amplify` issue or pull-request URL, or a GitHub row's "Amplify"
column, and refuses without one.
