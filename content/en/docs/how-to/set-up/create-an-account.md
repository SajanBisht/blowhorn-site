Your Blowhorn account lives in [Blowhorn](https://cloud.blowhorn.ai). The app's **Sign in** step has
two buttons:

- **Sign in:** opens your browser to sign in to an account you already have.
- **Create account:** opens your browser so you can sign up.

Either way, the browser comes straight back to the app. There is no
separate page asking you to allow the sign-in. The browser tab says
Blowhorn received the answer: close it and return to the app, where the
step has ticked off. The app never sees your password.

## How Create account works today

- **Your browser opens Blowhorn's sign-up page.** Sign in opens the
  sign-in page instead. Either one sends you back to the app when it
  finishes.
- **Google and GitHub work too:** they always run in your browser.
- **Nothing to copy or paste:** when sign-up finishes, the page hands you
  back to the app and the step ticks off.
- **Signing up with an email address adds a step:** Blowhorn sends you a
  verification email. After you follow its link, the browser goes straight
  back to the app and the step ticks off by itself. You do not need to
  switch back to the app or press anything there.
  The wait for a sign-up is ten minutes, twice the sign-in wait. If the
  wait runs out anyway, your account is kept: verify your email, then
  sign in. You do not need to create the account again.

From the command line, `blowhorn auth login --sign-up` does the same thing.
