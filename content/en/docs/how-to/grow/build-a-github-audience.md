# Build a GitHub audience

List the people around one or more repositories into your account with
`blowhorn source --platform github`: stargazers unless you name another
audience, one stored row per login. It does not follow, connect, or send
mail. The run lists with the profile's stored `GH_TOKEN`.

```bash
# Stargazers of one repository. Preview first: it lists and writes nothing.
blowhorn source --platform github --profile marcus --repo octocat/Hello-World --dry-run
blowhorn source --platform github --profile marcus --repo octocat/Hello-World

# Another audience, or several repositories at once.
blowhorn source --platform github --profile marcus --repo octocat/Hello-World --audience contributors
blowhorn source --platform github --profile marcus --repo octocat/Hello-World --repo octocat/Spoon-Knife --audience watchers
```

`--audience` is one of `owner`, `contributors`, `forks`, `stargazers`,
`watchers`, `subscribers`, or `issues`. `--audience all` lists their
union, and only when you type it. `--repo` repeats; at least one is
required. `--limit` caps the people examined in the run.
