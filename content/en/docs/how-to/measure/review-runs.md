Every action run appends one line per profile and platform to the run ledger,
dry or real. Read it back in the app under Activity › History, or grouped any way you
like:

```bash
blowhorn analytics operations --group-by host
blowhorn analytics operations --group-by profile --since 7d
blowhorn analytics operations --kind tick
```

`--group-by` takes `profile`, `platform`, `command`, `day` or `host`: the
ledger has always recorded which machine a run happened on, so grouping by
host shows who did what across the machines sharing your organization. `--kind
tick` aggregates the scheduler's own passes instead of the action runs.

A dry run counts apart and never as an operation: a preview is not work done.
Records exist from the first run after this command shipped, so an older
window reports zero rather than history.

To re-run a failure, run its command again by hand, or choose "try again" on
it in the app under Activity › History; a dry run first shows what the retry would do.
