Your Risk Profile is one choice for how risky and how fast Blowhorn
runs: cautious, standard (the default) or brisk. It sets pace, pointer
movement, caps, spacing, quiet hours, outreach, the pause after a
sign-in challenge, retries and how much runs at once, together. The
headline is ownership-first - "Your pace. Your risk. Your call." - and
the formal name stays Risk Profile: the tradeoff really is detection
and ban risk against speed, and it is the same term the CLI, the config
file and the reference use.

Choose it in the app on the **Safety** screen: the slider at the top is
the choice for everyone, a colour-graded track from cautious (slow end) to
brisk (fast end). The same mode shows on Home as a pill and as a
mini-slider in the menu-bar popover; both open Safety, and changing it
anywhere changes it everywhere. Or use `blowhorn risk set cautious`.
`blowhorn risk show` says which preset is in effect and where it came
from, and `blowhorn risk grid` lists every profile on every platform. Any
single dial you set yourself wins over the preset for that dial, and the
rest of the preset still applies around it; a profile with a dial set
outside the preset is a custom profile, not a fourth preset you can pick.

## Set one platform for everyone

To run one platform more carefully for every profile, for example
LinkedIn cautious while the rest stay standard:

1. Open **Safety**.
2. In the grid, pick the chip in the **Each platform** row under
   **LinkedIn**, and choose **Cautious**.

Or, from Terminal:

```bash
blowhorn risk set cautious --platform linkedin
```

The choice is kept with your organization, so every computer you run
Blowhorn on uses it, and the row's caption says **every computer**. If your
organization cannot keep it yet, it is saved on this computer only: the
command says `scope: this_computer` with the reason, and the row says
**this computer only**. Your organization's choice for that platform comes
first, so when it already has one, the command says it still applies on
every computer and this computer's choice has no effect until an
organization admin clears it. Choose **Inherit** in the same chip, or run
`blowhorn risk set default --platform linkedin`, to clear it.

## Set one profile, or one profile on one platform

- **One profile on every platform:** pick the chip in that profile's
  **Every platform** column, or `blowhorn risk set cautious --profile kate`.
- **One profile on one platform:** pick that profile's cell under the
  platform, or `blowhorn risk set brisk --profile kate --platform x`.

A chip you chose is filled; a dashed chip is inherited, and the line under
it says where it comes from ("from LinkedIn", "from this profile", "from
everyone"). To put a cell back, point at it and press its reset, or choose
**Inherit** in its menu; the menu names what it would inherit first.

## Which choice wins

The more specific choice wins: one activity beats one profile on one
platform, which beats a platform's or a profile's choice, which beats
everyone's. **When a platform and a profile both have a choice, the more
careful one wins**, so "LinkedIn cautious for everyone" also slows a profile
set to brisk, and "X brisk for everyone" never speeds up a profile set to
cautious. To let one profile go faster on one platform, choose its cell.
A new profile or computer still runs cautious for its first 14 days. The
full order is in
[Which choice wins](/docs/reference/configuration/#which-choice-wins).

## Adjust the limits yourself

Under the grid, **The limits Blowhorn keeps** starts from the preset: change
the pace and daily caps per platform in the **by platform** table, and the
other limits below it, including typing and pointer timing, then **save
limits**. The header reads "Custom, based on standard, 3 dials changed" once
dials move, and **reset to preset** puts every dial back. No dial may exceed a
built-in ceiling: your own cap can only lower a ceiling, never raise it.
Two dials carry a driver note: pauses and mistakes run on the Playwright
driver only. The extension driver sends one key per message and runs no
pause plan, so on that driver it types with the shaped delay from the delay
band and no pauses or corrections. The full values are in the
[configuration reference](/docs/reference/configuration/#risk-profile-presets),
with a stable anchor per dial in
[Risk Profile dials](/docs/reference/configuration/#risk-profile-dials).

## Cautious: one thing at a time, nights off

Pick cautious for a new account, a new computer, or an unattended run
you will not be watching.

- **Between actions:** at least 15 minutes, plus a random wait of up to
  15 minutes, between two public actions on one platform for one
  profile. A day of posting is therefore a slow trickle, not a burst.
- **How much per day:** a quarter of each platform's built-in ceiling.
  On LinkedIn that is 2 posts and 10 comments a day (before any cap
  you set yourself); on X it is 12 posts a day. Your own daily caps can
  only take these lower.
- **Nights:** nothing public from 22:00 to 07:00 local time. A due
  activity inside those hours waits until morning; it is not failed.
- **After a challenge:** if a platform shows a CAPTCHA, checkpoint or
  restriction page, that profile on that platform is held for 72 hours
  from the last such record.
- **Outreach:** off entirely - no connects, invites or follows.
- **At once:** at most 1 run, and one profile at a time on a platform.
  A second run is refused and names your Cautious profile; its
  activities stay queued.
- **Retries:** a failed scheduled job is not retried.

## Standard: today's behaviour, with the guardrails on

Standard is the built-in default, and the right choice when an account
is established and you want Blowhorn to behave the way it always has,
with the Risk Profile guardrails explicit rather than new.

- **Between actions:** no minimum spacing; pace still shapes typing
  cadence and the random pauses between actions.
- **How much per day:** the full built-in ceiling. On LinkedIn that is
  10 posts and 40 comments a day; on X it is 50 posts a day, before
  any cap you set yourself or a warmup ramp.
- **Nights:** no preset quiet hours. A quiet window you name yourself
  with `defaults.quiet_hours` still holds scheduled claims.
- **After a challenge:** the profile on that platform is held for 24
  hours.
- **Outreach:** on for established platforms, off on platforms still
  being built (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube).
- **At once:** one profile at a time on a platform, and no preset limit
  on runs overall. Setting `defaults.concurrency.max_runs` adds one.
- **Retries:** a failed scheduled job is not retried.

## Brisk: fast, while you watch

Pick brisk for an established account you are watching, when you want
the most throughput and accept the most exposure.

- **Between actions:** no minimum spacing, and the fast pace.
- **How much per day:** the full built-in ceiling, same as standard -
  brisk does not raise any ceiling, it only removes cautious's
  quarter-share, quiet hours, spacing and outreach limits.
- **Nights:** no preset quiet hours.
- **After a challenge:** the profile on that platform is held for 12
  hours - the shortest pause, so a challenge is the place brisk costs
  you the most caution.
- **Outreach:** on everywhere, including platforms still being built.
- **At once:** different profiles may share a platform, and no preset
  limit on runs overall. One profile is still held to one run on a
  platform.
- **Retries:** a failed scheduled job gets one retry. A login is never
  retried, and a retry is never granted for an unknown outcome.

## A new profile warms up cautious, whatever you chose

A new profile or a new Mac runs cautious for scheduled jobs until it
has history - 14 days, whatever preset you picked. Its caps ramp over
those 14 days, from about a quarter of cautious's caps on day one
(about 1 LinkedIn post a day) to cautious's full caps by day 14, and
only then does your chosen preset take over. A profile idle longer
than the 15-day ledger window warms up again. A run you start yourself
is not held by the warmup, only warned about, and it follows your
chosen preset's caps, quiet hours and outreach.

## If you are still unsure

- New account, or you will not watch it: cautious.
- Established account, normal use: standard.
- Established account, you are watching, and you want the most done
  today: brisk.
- One account needs to be slower than the rest: set that profile or
  platform cautious, and leave the rest alone - the choice is per
  profile and per platform, not only computer-wide.
- One platform feels risky for everyone: set that platform cautious in
  the **Each platform** row.

## One activity on its own preset

One recurring activity can run cautious while everything else on the
same profile and platform runs standard: open the activity, set
**Risk profile** (blank means inherit, exactly as before), and save.
From the terminal the same value is `risk_profile=cautious` in the
activity's params. The activity's detail then shows the preset and
where it came from (`Cautious · this activity`, or `Cautious ·
inherits: LinkedIn × work profile`), and while the profile is warming
it also says what the tick enforces (`warming: runs Cautious for
now`). An activity without one profile and one platform names no
single preset; its targets resolve their own. For a single run you
start by hand, `blowhorn --risk-profile cautious post ...` overrides
everything for that run only.
