Stop Blowhorn from claiming scheduled work without stopping the service. Reach
for this when a platform challenges a sign-in, when a session expires, or on
any day you want nothing to go out.

{{< major >}}Whole unit standing down. Your call. Unpause when you're ready.{{< /major >}}

## Stop everything

```bash
blowhorn stop --all --reason "a post is going out wrong"
blowhorn stop --resume --all
```

Reach for `stop` when something is going wrong right now. A pause stops new
claims; a stop also ends the work already running. `blowhorn stop --all`
raises the all-computers pause below and records the stop in your account,
with who stopped it, when, and the reason you gave. Every acting process (a
scheduled pass, the queue working through posts, a run you started by hand)
checks that record at the same safe points a cancel is honoured at and ends
there, never mid-post. The activity in progress returns to the queue, and
its run record reads cancelled with the stop's reason.

Without `--all`, `blowhorn stop` stops this computer only: it sets this
computer's pause and asks the pass running here to stop, the two things you
would otherwise combine by hand. Nothing on any other computer changes.

`blowhorn stop --resume` lifts the stop, and only what the stop set. If
this computer, or every computer, was already paused before the stop, that
pause stays: a stop never lifts a pause it did not raise. While a stop
stands, `blowhorn schedule list` shows it live and `blowhorn schedule
status` shows it as of the last pass: who stopped everything, when, and why.

In Blowhorn the stop record rides the same preferences as the
pause, so `stop --all` works the same way there. On an older Blowhorn
that does not carry the stop yet, `stop --all` still raises the
all-computers pause, so nothing new is claimed anywhere, but a pass
already running on another computer finishes the activity it is on
instead of stopping mid-pass. The command says so when it happens.

In the app, **stop everything** is in the popover footer, beside the
Stand down controls. It asks for a reason and a confirmation first - nothing
stops on the first click. Stop everything is the emergency control; Stand
down is not. The standing down board then shows a **stop** line with who
stopped it, when and why, and that board's **stop everything** control
is the way back: turning it off lifts the stop, and the pause it raised
with it. A pause you set by hand is never the stop's to lift, and its
own control stays beside the stop's.

## Pause this computer

```bash
blowhorn schedule pause --reason "LinkedIn challenge on kate"
blowhorn schedule status
blowhorn schedule resume
```

The flagless pause writes a local file beside your config, so it works even
when everything else is broken, and it survives a crash, a restart and a
reboot. Ticks keep running every ten minutes but claim nothing and exit 0.
Due times carry forward: a recurring activity that fell due during the pause runs
once on resume, not once per missed interval.

A job already running finishes first. Killing a browser flow mid-post can leave
a half-done action on the platform, so the pause stops the next claim, never
the running job.

In the app this pause is called **Stand down**, and lifting it is
**Reenlist**. Use the duty toggle at the bottom of the console rail: it reads
**On duty** with **Stand down** beside it, or **Standing down** with
**Reenlist**, and the round thumb is teal or amber to match. ⌘⇧P does the same,
and so does "stand down this computer" in the popover or the menu. It takes one
click and no reason. Home's Fleet card offers the same toggle on this
computer's row. While this computer is standing down, the app also skips its
session probe, so it opens no browser at all.

## Pause every computer, or one activity

```bash
blowhorn schedule pause --all --reason "X is rate limiting us"
blowhorn schedule pause --activity 7 --reason "waiting on the page owner"
blowhorn schedule resume --all
blowhorn schedule resume --activity 7
```

An activity is claimed only when none of the three scopes says paused: this computer,
all computers, or that activity. `--all` and `--activity` live in your account, so every
computer sharing it honours them on its next claim; the flagless pause never
touches your account. In the app every scope is a Stand down / Reenlist pair:

- **This computer** - the rail's duty toggle, the flagless pause above.
- **The fleet** (every computer sharing your schedule, `--all`) - the
  **Entire fleet** row on Home's Fleet card, or "stand down the fleet" in the
  popover, This computer and Safety. A reason is optional; on Home you type
  it beside the toggle and it saves as you type. While the fleet stands down,
  the card shows who stood it down, when and why, and this computer's row
  waits for the fleet to reenlist.
- **This order** (`--activity N`) - the duty switch inside an item's drawer:
  **Scheduled** with **Stand down**, or **Standing down** with **Reenlist**.
  The optional reason field above it saves as you type, with a teal check
  once saved, and goes out with the Stand down. The item's list row reads
  **standing down** while it is held.

There is no Stand down for another computer: stand that computer down from
its own Blowhorn app, or stand down the whole fleet.

Lifting one scope leaves the other two as they were. A held activity still reads
`due: yes` beside `paused: yes` in `blowhorn schedule list`: due keeps meaning
its time has passed. A pause is not `Enabled: no`: disabling an activity is
editorial, with no reason and no intent to resume.

`trigger-now` on a held activity exits 1 and names the scope. `--ignore-pause` on
`tick` or `trigger-now` overrides every scope, and a dry run previews through
the pause: held activities read `held` rather than `would-run`.

## Quiet hours: the pause that keeps your hours

A pause is a decision you make in the moment. Quiet hours are the standing
version: name the hours when nothing should go out, and due activities wait
them out on their own.

```bash
blowhorn config set defaults.quiet_hours 22:00-07:00
blowhorn config set defaults.quiet_hours_tz America/New_York
```

The window may wrap midnight, as `22:00-07:00` does, and is read in
`defaults.quiet_hours_tz` - unset, this computer's own zone. In the app, the
same two fields sit under Settings, in the defaults card's quiet hours
group; clearing the window there turns quiet hours off. While a window is
in force, the menu-bar popover says so - `quiet until 07:00`, the window's
end. An activity due inside the window is not claimed and not failed: it
stays due and runs on the first pass after the window ends, the way a
paused activity carries forward.
`blowhorn schedule list` marks it `held (quiet hours)` with the window and
the hour it lifts, and `blowhorn schedule why N` names quiet hours as the
reason. Nothing is stored; the hold is computed from the clock on every pass.

A profile whose audience keeps different hours carries its own: set its
**Quiet Hours** and **Quiet Hours Time Zone** settings and they win over the
defaults for that profile's activities, each key on its own.

`--ignore-quiet-hours` on `tick` or `trigger-now` runs through the window
once, the way `--ignore-pause` runs through a pause; `trigger-now` inside
the window otherwise exits 1 and says so. Quiet hours hold scheduled work
only - a command you run by hand is yours, exactly as a pause never stops one.
