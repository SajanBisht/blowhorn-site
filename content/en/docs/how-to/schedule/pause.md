Stop Blowhorn from claiming scheduled work without stopping the service. Reach
for this when a platform challenges a sign-in, when a session expires, or on
any day you want nothing to go out.

{{< major >}}Whole unit standing down. Your call. Unpause when you're ready.{{< /major >}}

## Pause this computer

```bash
blowhorn schedule pause --reason "LinkedIn challenge on kate"
blowhorn schedule status
blowhorn schedule resume
```

The flagless pause writes a local file beside your config, so it works even
when everything else is broken, and it survives a crash, a restart and a
reboot. Ticks keep running every ten minutes but claim nothing and exit 0.
Due times carry forward: a recurring activity that fell due during the pause runs
once on resume, not once per missed interval.

A job already running finishes first. Killing a browser flow mid-post can leave
a half-done action on the platform, so the pause stops the next claim, never
the running job.

In the app, choose "pause this computer" in the popover or the menu, or
**Pause** beside the status line at the bottom of the console rail. It is one
toggle: choose it again to turn the pause off. While
paused, the app also skips its session probe, so a paused Blowhorn opens no
browser at all.

## Pause every computer, or one activity

```bash
blowhorn schedule pause --all --reason "X is rate limiting us"
blowhorn schedule pause --activity 7 --reason "waiting on the page owner"
blowhorn schedule resume --all
blowhorn schedule resume --activity 7
```

An activity is claimed only when none of the three scopes says paused: this computer,
all computers, or that activity. `--all` and `--activity` live in your account, so every
computer sharing it honours them on its next claim; the flagless pause never
touches your account. In the app the same three scopes are "pause this
computer", "pause all computers" and "pause this one" (in an item's drawer),
each with a reason; the first two are toggles you press again to turn the
pause off. Home says which pause holds - "Paused on this computer", "Paused
on all computers", or both - and its "Turn pause off" lifts that pause only.

Lifting one scope leaves the other two as they were. A held activity still reads
`due: yes` beside `paused: yes` in `blowhorn schedule list`: due keeps meaning
its time has passed. A pause is not `Enabled: no`: disabling an activity is
editorial, with no reason and no intent to resume.

`trigger-now` on a held activity exits 1 and names the scope. `--ignore-pause` on
`tick` or `trigger-now` overrides every scope, and a dry run previews through
the pause: held activities read `held` rather than `would-run`.
