One command names the reason an activity has or has not run on this computer, in the
order the scheduler itself decides it, and ends in one plain sentence:

```bash
blowhorn schedule why 7
```

```text
activity 7 · post · your-profile · linkedin

  enabled        yes
  valid          yes
  paused         no - activity not held, studio not paused, all-machines not paused
  due            yes - next_run_at 2026-08-31 06:00:00, 14 min ago
  claimed        yes - laptop:9912 since 2026-08-31 06:02:10, lease expires 2026-08-31 06:32:10
  this machine   studio · store reachable · last tick 2026-08-31 06:14:02 (2 min ago)
  last run       2026-08-30 06:03:11 on laptop · ok · 12 attempted, 12 confirmed

studio did not run activity 7 because laptop:9912 claimed it at 2026-08-31 06:02:10 and still holds the lease (expires 2026-08-31 06:32:10).
```

Read it top to bottom: enabled, valid, paused (naming the scope and how to lift
it), due, claimed, this computer, last run. The closing sentence is the answer;
quote it in a bug report with `--json` for the same answer scripts can read.

## What the common answers mean

- **Paused.** The scope is named: the activity, this computer, or all computers. Lift
  it with `blowhorn schedule resume`, with `--all` or `--activity 7` to match.
- **Claimed by another computer.** A claim is a lease, not a lock: the holder
  renews it every ten minutes while the job runs, and a dead computer stops
  renewing, so its activities return to the pool when the lease lapses. `schedule
  list` names every holder in its Locked By column; your own claims read
  `(this machine)`. Another macOS user's claims on the same Mac do not: they
  share the computer's name, not your install.
- **Not due.** `Next Run At` has not passed yet. `schedule status` shows an
  estimated next tick for this computer.
- **Gave up.** The last run used the activity's final retry, so it is `failed`
  with no next time. For a repeating activity the whole series has stopped -
  deliberately: repeated failures usually mean a broken sign-in or a platform
  checkpoint, and retrying on the recurrence risks the account. Give the
  activity a new time to restart it (the series, if it repeats) with a fresh
  set of retries.
- **Invalid.** `blowhorn schedule validate` names what the activity breaks.
- **Out of date.** `schedule status` names the cause `app_outdated`: the
  server's minimum app version is newer than this build, so the pass
  claims nothing and every activity stays due. Update Blowhorn
  ([Update Blowhorn](/docs/how-to/manage/update-blowhorn/)) and the next pass
  claims again; nothing is lost, because due activities are not
  consumed by a pass that refuses to claim.

The command is read-only: it claims nothing, runs nothing and changes nothing,
so it is safe against an activity that is mid-flight.
