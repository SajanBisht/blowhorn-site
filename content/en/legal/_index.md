description: How Blowhorn handles your data, sessions and accounts, in plain language, and every policy that covers the Blowhorn website, the Blowhorn app for macOS and the Blowhorn Chrome extension.
lead: Blowhorn runs as many public voices as you need from one coordinated queue, and every action happens on your own Mac. This page collects every policy that covers the Blowhorn website, the Blowhorn app for macOS and its Chrome extension, with a plain-language summary of each. The summaries are a guide; where one differs from a policy, the policy decides.

  - title: Every action happens on your own Mac
    text: Blowhorn never acts for you from a server. Every post, comment and reaction is made by the Blowhorn app on one of your Macs, and in Chrome the Blowhorn extension acts only when that app asks. Your browser cookies for LinkedIn, X, Reddit and Hacker News stay in Chrome on that Mac and never leave it.

    linkText: What stays on your Mac
  - title: The extension reports to no server
    text: The extension talks only to the Blowhorn app on your Mac, over Chrome's native messaging. It acts only on the sites Blowhorn supports, only in the Chrome profiles you install it in, and it keeps nothing itself.

    linkText: What the extension reads
  - title: No analytics, no crash reports, no cookies
    text: The app carries no analytics or crash-reporting library. This website sets no cookies, runs no analytics and loads nothing from third parties; its one outside request is the release lookup on GitHub that the privacy page describes.

    linkText: What this website does
  - title: One store for your queue, analytics and credentials
    text: Your organization's store on Layer5 Cloud holds the content queue, schedule, profiles, run history, analytics and platform credentials. That is what lets you install Blowhorn on any number of Macs, yours or your teammates', and run them as one. Every Mac works from the same queue, and the Macs coordinate through it, so the same post isn't sent from two of them. Analytics show the complete picture. Every row is scoped to your organization's id, and Layer5's privacy policy governs that data.

  - title: You approve what goes out
    text: Blowhorn publishes the rows you approve and the commands you run, from the accounts you configure. A dry run publishes nothing, and on Hacker News Blowhorn submits and comments only; it never votes.

    linkText: Your accounts and your content
  - title: Releases you can check
    text: The official downloads are signed disk images published with a SHA256SUMS.txt file to check them against, and a release is never replaced in place. The Blowhorn software is licensed under the AGPL-3.0.
