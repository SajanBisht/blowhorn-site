# Blowhorn site design rules

The full design language lives in [DESIGN.md in the blowhorn repository](https://github.com/blowhorn-ai/blowhorn/blob/master/DESIGN.md). This file holds the site's spacing and copy rules; keep the two in sync.

## Whitespace and rhythm

Whitespace separates ideas. A title never touches its content, and sections never run together. On the site these rules live in one token block at the end of `assets/css/site.css` ("Whitespace and rhythm"); shared classes (`.section`, `.agent-section`, `.compare-section`, `.brand-section`, `.section-head`, `.page-head`, `.section-body`, `.grid`, `.card`) read the tokens, so spacing is structural, never a per-page patch.

| Token | Mobile | Desktop (>= 900px) | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--section-y` | 64px | 112px | Section padding-block |
| `--head-gap` | 32px | 40px | Section head (or bare h2) to its content, minimum |
| `--eyebrow-gap` | 12px | 12px | Label to heading |
| `--intro-gap` | 16px | 16px | Heading to its intro paragraph |
| `--grid-gap` | 24px | 32px | Card grid gutters |
| `--stack-gap` | 16px | 16px | Stacked items (FAQ, lists) |
| `--card-pad` | 24px | 32px | Card padding |
| `--text-measure` | 64ch | 64ch | Paragraph line length |

Rules:

- Never let a title touch its content: heading-to-content is at least `--head-gap` (32px mobile, 40px desktop). Wrap the title and intro in `.section-head`; whatever follows gets the gap automatically.
- Separate sections with whitespace first (`--section-y` on both sides). Neighboring sections get a faded hairline divider; glass panels that are their own section float with half a section of air instead. Use background shifts only where a section is a distinct moment (CTA, the Major).
- Keep paragraphs at or under `--text-measure` (about 60-68 characters). Section heads max out at 44rem.
- Cards get `--card-pad` on every side and `--grid-gap` between them. Don't shrink either to fit more in; cut copy instead.
- Never hard-code a margin or padding in px on a page template. Add or reuse a token.
- Check 1280, 390 and 320 widths, light and dark, before merging.

## Concision

Say less, more clearly. Turn the verbosity dial down a notch from your first draft.

- One idea per sentence. Cut a sentence before you add one.
- Section intros are 2 sentences or fewer. Card bodies are about 30 words or fewer.
- Cut redundant clauses, filler ("that is what lets you", "as many as you need"), and doubled examples. One example beats three.
- Keep facts, guardrail wording and SEO terms; cut the padding around them. Don't shorten legal text substantively.
- No em dashes. No period at the end of a section title.

## PR checklist: whitespace and concision

- [ ] Every heading has at least `--head-gap` before its content; nothing touches
- [ ] New sections use the shared section and `.section-head` classes, not page-specific spacing
- [ ] Sections are clearly separated (whitespace, then divider or background shift if needed)
- [ ] Paragraphs stay within `--text-measure`; cards use `--card-pad` and `--grid-gap`
- [ ] Checked at 1280, 390 and 320 px, light and dark
- [ ] Intros <= 2 sentences, card bodies <= ~30 words, one idea per sentence
- [ ] No em dashes; no trailing periods on section titles

## Code and commands

Anywhere the site shows a command a reader might run, it can be copied in one click. Full rule: the "Code and commands" section of the design language DESIGN.md.

- Every code block is a terminal code card (`layouts/_partials/code-card.html`); docs fences get it through `layouts/_markup/render-codeblock.html`. Declare the language of the card's actual content.
- Shell prompts (`$`) and sample output are never copied. Untyped or `text` fences are output: no copy button.
- Inline `blowhorn ...` commands in prose get a small copy button; commands with placeholders are not copyable.
- Copy buttons are real buttons with an `aria-label`, keyboard reachable, and announce "Copied" through `aria-live`.

## Interface art

The miniature product UI in the Product menu and the homepage "Ways in" section is one partial, `layouts/_partials/interface-art.html` (styles under "Interface art" in `assets/css/site.css`). It is drawn from the real surfaces, never invented:

- **Desktop app** copies the console: lights at the top of the left rail (hidden-inset title bar, no URL bar), the Crowhorn and wordmark, "+ New activity", the five places (Home, Activity, Profiles, Performance, Safety) and the "on watch" status line, beside Activity's Upcoming list. Sources in the product repository: `desktop/src/renderer/console/ConsoleRail.tsx`, `places.ts` and `desktop/src/ui/PlatformIcon.tsx`. When the app's rail or vocabulary changes, update the art.
- **Web app** and **Chrome extension** share a Chrome-on-Mac frame (`interface-art-browser.html`): lights at the far left of the tab strip, back/forward/reload, the omnibox, a bookmarks bar; the extension adds the pinned Blowhorn icon.
- Platform marks are the app's monoline marks (`interface-art-mark.html`), not filled brand logos. App labels say "activity", never "post".
- The menu's narrow rows draw the art at 92px; a container query in the same CSS keeps each piece legible there. Check both widths, light and dark.

## Mascot consistency

Major Blowhorn must look the same in every scene. Image tools give no seed control, so consistency comes from references and a locked prompt, not luck. Full procedure and the prompt block: `marketing/brand/major-blowhorn/consistency.md` in the blowhorn repository.

- Start every new scene from the official vector art in `static/assets/brand/mascot/` or the canonical reference sheet (`marketing/brand/major-blowhorn/reference/`).
- Paste the locked character and style prompt block verbatim into every generation, and attach the reference sheet plus the official mascot image as reference images every time.
- Review each output against the sheet (comb, campaign hat, teal body, amber hackles, yellow beak and legs, medals, Old Thunderlung's dent and red tassel). Regenerate rejects. Log every prompt in `prompts.md`.
- Default pose: open beak, barking into the horn like a bullhorn; trumpet-playing only occasionally.
- Oil-painting style: attach `army.jpg`, `signal.jpg` and `hero.jpg` from `marketing/brand/oil-style/` as reference images for every new scene. Canonical look: broad charcoal campaign hat with a gold band, heavy red jowls under the beak, gold epaulettes on both shoulders.
- Lore art for /major/ lives in `static/assets/brand/mascot/lore/` as WebP with alt text.

## Speech bubbles

Every bubble uses `layouts/_partials/bubble.html`; styles are under "Speech bubble" in `assets/css/site.css`. The body and tail are one silhouette with one continuous outline. Never draw a tail as its own stroked shape. Tails: `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`, or `auto` (bottom on narrow screens, left from 720px). The live specimen is on /brand/#bubbles.

| Variant | Use for | Fill | Outline | Text | Contrast |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| default (neutral) | quotes, lists of lines | surface | near-black, cream in dark | ink-wordmark | 9.3:1 light, 16.3:1 dark |
| `paper` | Major speaking | cream | yellow-shade | charcoal | 8.6:1 |
| `mint` | what a person says to an agent | mint | teal-deep | charcoal | 6.9:1 |
| `command` | Major's orders, calls to action | teal-deep | none | white | 5.6:1 |

Paper, mint and command keep their colours in dark mode so a voice looks the same in both themes; neutral follows the theme. All pass WCAG AA for body text.

- Do pick the variant by who is talking, and use the same variant for the same voice on every page.
- Do keep command to one per section.
- Don't mix variants within one list, put links or buttons inside a bubble, or use teal (#00B39F) as a fill under white text (2.6:1).
- The storybook variant is retired: its only page, the /home-alt/ preview, was deleted with the flat storybook art.
