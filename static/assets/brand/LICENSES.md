# Licences for the assets in this directory

## Brand assets (`logo/`, `mascot/`, `marketing/`, `tokens.json`)

The Blowhorn name, the Crowhorn mark, the Blowhorn wordmark, Major Blowhorn and
the marketing art are copyright Layer5, Inc. They are published here for the
site's pages and, with the downloadable kit on the Brand page (`/brand/`), so
press, partners and the community can refer to Blowhorn. They are not licensed
for use in anyone else's product names, logos or marks. The files are byte-identical copies of version 1 of
the brand kit (`brand/` in the Blowhorn product repository, landed as
PR #354). Never recolour, outline, shadow or rotate the mark; see the brand
book for the rules.

The locked-6 Major Blowhorn cutout (`mascot/locked-6/major-6-hat-left.png`) is the
product repository's `marketing/brand/major-blowhorn/cutouts/major-6-hat-left.png`,
copied unchanged; the `.webp` beside it is
a lossy re-encode of that file for the home page hero, with no other change.

Old Thunderlung (`mascot/thunderlung/`, PNG and WebP) is the product repository's
`marketing/brand/major-blowhorn/thunderlung/brand-style/` cutouts of Major's bugle,
with and without its red cord, approved 28 Oct 2026 and copied unchanged.

The two kits on the Brand page (`/brand/blowhorn-brand-kit.zip` and
`/brand/blowhorn-logo-kit.zip`) are built by the product repository and published
unchanged, under the same terms. They carry no font files: the full kit's
README links the three families on Google Fonts.

The cast art (`cast/*.webp`) is 960x540 re-encodes of the cast locked on 18 Oct 2026
(`marketing/brand/cast/` in the product repository), unchanged otherwise, plus the four
machine Recruit Chicks (`cast/recruit-chick-macbook`, `-imac`, `-laptop-lap` and `-mac-studio`) added on
20 Oct 2026. The `cast/icons/*.webp` files are square crops of the same art with the black ground keyed out. `cast/major-6-hat-left-horn.webp` is the locked
`major-6-hat-left` art with three Caribbean Green (#00D3A9) sound arcs added at the
bullhorn; Major himself is not redrawn.

## Fonts (`fonts/`)

All three families are licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1
(`fonts/OFL.txt`). The woff2 files were produced from the upstream variable
masters published in [google/fonts](https://github.com/google/fonts) with
fontTools: Bricolage Grotesque keeps its `opsz` and `wght` axes with the
`wdth` axis pinned to 100; the Instrument Sans and JetBrains Mono files are
static instances at the weights `tokens.json` names.

## Platform logos (`../platforms/`)

The site shows each platform's own published logo, unmodified, so readers
recognize the platforms Blowhorn works with. The files in
`static/assets/platforms/` are byte-identical copies of what each owner
publishes, downloaded on 9 October 2026. They are never recoloured, redrawn,
cropped, outlined or animated; each sits alone on a white tile with the
platform's name as its label, and the home page, docs landing and footer
carry the trademark line below.

their respective owners. Blowhorn is not affiliated with or endorsed by any of
them. The logos are used only to name the platforms Blowhorn works with, under
each owner's brand guidelines, and are not licensed for any other use.

## Organisation logos (`../orgs/`)

The logo ticker under the home page hero shows the horizontal logos of
organisations Blowhorn users work at (`data/user_logos.json`). The current
set of 22 was supplied by the Blowhorn team on 25 October 2026 (dropped in
the repo as `user-logos/`) and replaced the previous set the same day. The
files are the owners' logos with one uniform treatment applied before
publishing, so the strip reads as one set: converted to grayscale, each
canvas or viewBox trimmed to the drawn art (full-canvas background shapes
removed), and the five white lockups (Apptega, Aqueduct, Clutch, Innovacare,
Northwinds) stored inverted, so the set reads dark on the light ground at
one height. The logos render bare, with no plate or tile behind them; in
dark mode the strip is inverted by CSS, which returns the five stored
inversions to their original white. No logo is redrawn, outlined or
re-proportioned; aspect ratios are the owners' own.
