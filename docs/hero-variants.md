# Home page hero variants

The home page hero's headline, subhead and illustration come from [`data/hero.json`](../data/hero.json),
which must validate against [`schemas/hero.schema.json`](../schemas/hero.schema.json)
(`make check-schemas`, part of `make site-check` and so of CI). Each variant has an `id`,
a `headline`, a `subhead`, an optional `art` (`stage` or `fan`, default `stage`), the
numbers of the canonical differentiators it rests on and an optional reviewer `note`.
Copy may only state what those differentiators allow, in their wording rules.

## The rotation

`rotation` is the config object. `rotation.mode` is `utc-day` (production) or
`interval`. `rotation.ids` lists the heroes that take turns, in order. Omit `ids`
to rotate every variant. Variants not listed stay in the file for later.

Production rotates these five, one per UTC day:

1. `not-a-bot`: "Not a bot. You, at full volume." over the hero stage, Major Blowhorn
   barking into your own Chrome while the post types itself. Default and fallback.
2. `real-you`: "The real you, everywhere at once."
3. `your-fleet`: "Your fleet. Your Chrome. Your voice."
4. `sound-wave`: "Real voices make a sound wave."
5. `own-your-voice`: "Own your voice. Keep your accounts."

The platforms section headline lives in `data/integrations.json` (`headline`).
It is not a hero. The old line "Say it once. Say it everywhere." stays on the
Reveille homepage only.

At page load each visitor gets one of

```
rotation.ids[floor(UTC days since the epoch) % length]   # mode: utc-day
rotation.ids[floor(now / intervalSeconds) % length]      # mode: interval
```

`utc-day` is whole UTC days since the Unix epoch, so every visitor sees the same
hero on the same day and the turn happens at 00:00 UTC. `interval` needs
`rotation.intervalSeconds` (a positive integer). The pick happens once: the hero
never changes while someone is reading the page.

## How it renders

- [`layouts/_partials/hero-rotation.html`](../layouts/_partials/hero-rotation.html) reads
  the data file and fails the build if `rotation.ids` names an unknown variant
  or if `default` is not in the rotating ids. Mode and `intervalSeconds` are
  schema-checked (`make check-schemas`).
- [`layouts/home.html`](../layouts/home.html) renders the hero once: one `h1` and one
  subhead holding a `<span data-hero-only="<id>">` per rotating hero, the shared label,
  buttons and social proof, and one figure per art used by the rotation, each from its own
  partial in [`layouts/_partials/hero-art/`](../layouts/_partials/hero-art/).
- [`layouts/_partials/hero-rotation-head.html`](../layouts/_partials/hero-rotation-head.html),
  in the page's `head`, carries a few lines of CSS that hide every span and figure except
  the picked one, and a few lines of inline script that pick the hero and set
  `data-hero` and `data-hero-art` on `<html>`. It runs before the body is parsed, so the
  first paint already shows the right hero: no flash and no layout shift.
- Hidden copy and art are `display: none`, so screen readers get only the visible hero
  and the page has one `h1`.
- Without JavaScript the attributes are never set and the CSS shows `default`.
  `default` also feeds the meta, Open Graph, Twitter and JSON-LD descriptions
  ([`layouts/_partials/hero-variant.html`](../layouts/_partials/hero-variant.html)), so
  crawlers and social previews always get it. `content/en/_index.md`'s `description` is
  front matter and does not follow the data file: update it by hand when the default
  changes.
- While the fan is the hero, the Platforms section hides its own copy of the fan
  (`.platforms-fan` in `assets/css/site.css`), so it never appears twice.
- Each art keeps its own motion and `prefers-reduced-motion` rules. Switching heroes adds
  no transition.

## Hero media

The hero visual comes from `media` in `data/hero.json`
(schema: `schemas/hero.schema.json`). `media.default` names it for every
hero: `video` (the hero film) or `demo` (the interactive pseudo-app demo
from `data/hero_demo.json`). A hero can set its own `"media": "demo"` or
`"media": "video"` to override it, and `?hero=<id>` picks the hero and so
its media. The pre-paint picker sets `data-hero-media` on `<html>` and only
the matching `[data-hero-media-only]` visual shows; no-JS visitors get the
default hero's.

`media.video` holds the film: `mp4` (H.264, faststart) and `webm` (VP9) under
`static/assets/video/`, a `poster`, its `width` and `height`, and an
accessible `label` and `description`. Captions are burned into the picture.
The default is the Battalion Thunder film (source:
leecalcote/blowhorn `marketing/videos/blowhorn-battalion-thunder`), 1080p,
about 1.9 MB MP4 and 2.1 MB WebM.

`media.video.placement` is `inline-expand` (the only placement): the film
sits small in the hero beside the headline, subhead and calls to action
(below them on phones), on its poster with a Play the film button.
`?hero=<id>` still swaps the copy. `assets/js/hero-video.js` then:

- grows the frame in one FLIP motion from its spot to 90% of the window
  width (all of it at 640 px and under), centered and fitted to the window
  height, as a modal dialog (`role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`) over a dimmed
  backdrop, and plays it once it has grown;
- traps focus in the dialog (Sound, Pause, Close) and locks page scroll;
- closes on Escape, a backdrop click or Close: it pauses the film, shrinks
  it back to exactly its spot and returns focus to the Play button (now
  Resume the film).

Under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` it opens and closes without the
motion. Without JavaScript the native video controls show inline.

`media.video.playback` (schema-checked): `autoplay` is always `false`;
`loop` replays it from the start; `sound` starts it with sound on Play (the
click is the user gesture browsers need for audio); `end` is `poster` or
`last-frame` when it ends without looping, with a Watch again button in
the dialog. Production is no loop, sound on, `end: poster`.

To re-encode after a new render:

```sh
ffmpeg -i film.mp4 -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -crf 25 -tune animation -preset slow -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart -c:a aac -b:a 64k -ac 1 static/assets/video/battalion-thunder.mp4
ffmpeg -i film.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -crf 38 -b:v 0 -row-mt 1 -c:a libopus -b:a 48k -ac 1 static/assets/video/battalion-thunder.webm
ffmpeg -ss 12.2 -i film.mp4 -frames:v 1 -q:v 3 static/assets/video/battalion-thunder-poster.jpg
```

## Adding a hero

1. Add the variant to `variants` (with `art` if it is not the stage).
2. Add its id to `rotation.ids`.
3. For a new illustration, add `layouts/_partials/hero-art/<art>.html` (a `figure` with
   `class="hero-art"` and `data-hero-art-only="<art>"`, every id in it unique on the
   page) and add `<art>` to the `art` enum in the schema.

## Review URLs

`?hero=<n>` (1-based position in `rotation.ids`) or `?hero=<id>` (any id in
`rotation.ids`) forces a hero, for example `https://blowhorn.ai/?hero=2` or
`http://localhost:1313/?hero=real-you` on a local `make site`. Anything else is
ignored and the time rule applies.

No analytics or third-party script may be added to measure heroes (`check-third-party`).
