# Blowhorn Tells on blowhorn.ai

[Blowhorn Tells](https://tells.blowhorn.ai/) is the free "Am I a Bot?" check:
it runs in the reader's browser on page load, checks the bot-detection and
fingerprinting signals a website can read, explains each in plain words and
gives a verdict. The site promotes it in fixed places, all driven from one
data file.

## Where it lives

| What | File |
| --- | --- |
| Base URL, Tells pages, UTM parameters, placements, all copy | `data/tells.json` (schema: `schemas/tells.schema.json`) |
| The only place a Tells URL is built | `layouts/_partials/tells-link.html` |
| Whether a page may promote Tells (public pages, never `/internal/`) | `layouts/_partials/tells-show.html` |
| Styles | "Blowhorn Tells" in `assets/css/site.css`; the docs card in `assets/scss/_styles_project.scss` |
| Contract check | `.github/scripts/check_tells.py` (`make check-tells`, part of `site-check`) |

Build a link with the partial; never hard-code a Tells URL in a template:

```go-html-template
<a href="{{ partial "tells-link.html" (dict "placement" "home" "page" "checks") }}">What each check means</a>
```

`page` is `home` (default), `checks` (`/checks/`, "What each check means") or
`agents` (`/agents/`, "For AI agents and scripts"). `placement` becomes
`utm_content`; an unknown page or placement fails the build. Every link gets
`utm_source=blowhorn.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tells`.

## Placements

| Placement | Where | Template |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bar` | Slim, dismissible bar above the header on every public page | `tells-bar.html`, `tells-bar-head.html`, `assets/js/tells-bar.js` |
| `nav` | Top-level "Am I a Bot?" item with a Free pill, before Pricing; also the Resources menu entry | `header.html` |
| `home` | Band after Trust on the Signal home page (Sleeper Cell art) | `home/tells.html` |
| `footer` | Free tools column | `footer.html` |
| `compare` | Callout before the FAQ on every `/compare/<slug>/` page, and the FAQ links that point at Tells | `tells-callout.html` in `versus.html` |
| `ai`, `agents` | Callout after the first section of `/ai/` and `/agents/` | `tells-callout.html` in `ai.html`, `agents.html` |
| `thanks` | Card after the install steps on `/download/thanks/` | `download-thanks.html` |
| `docs` | Card under the table of contents (1280px and up), else at the end of the page | `tells-docs-card.html` in `docs/baseof.html` |
| `404` | Line under the 404 message | `404.html` |

The alternate home layouts (`/home-oil/`, `/home-reveille/`) do not render
`signal.html` and carry no band. Prose links in the docs (synced from the
product repository), the Field Manual, the Trust Center and the role and
solution FAQs stay untagged on purpose; `check_tells.py` ignores links without
UTM parameters.

## The announcement bar

Dismissing the bar stores `dismissed` under `bar.storage_key`
(`bh-tells-bar-v1`) in localStorage. An inline script in the head
(`tells-bar-head.html`) sets `data-tells-bar="off"` on `<html>` before first
paint, so a returning reader never sees it flash or the header jump. To show
the bar again to everyone, bump the key (for example `bh-tells-bar-v2`). The
close button is hidden until the script runs, so without JavaScript the bar
simply stays. The bar scrolls away with the page; the mobile menu sheet sizes
itself from the header's real bottom edge (`--sheet-top`, `assets/js/nav.js`).

## Copy rules

Marketing placements say "browser", never "Chrome", and "computer", never
"Mac"; only the docs card says "Chrome profile" (docs are group (c) in
AGENTS.md). No prices, counts or em dashes. Do not claim more about Tells
than its own site says: free, runs in your browser, explains each signal,
verdict, Copy/Download JSON, an optional "prove you are human" drill, no
sign-up, keeps no copy and no logs, open source.
