# Deploying the site

How the Hugo site in this repository becomes blowhorn.ai: the build, the
GitHub Pages deployment, the custom domain, the DNS records the registrar
needs, and how to verify a deployment.

## What deploys, and when

[`site.yml`](../.github/workflows/site.yml) runs on every pull request and on
every push to `master`:

1. It installs the pinned toolchain: Go from [`go.mod`](../go.mod) (Hugo
   fetches Docsy as a Hugo module), Node.js from [`.nvmrc`](../.nvmrc), and
   Hugo extended and postcss from [`package.json`](../package.json) with
   `npm ci`. The checkout has full history so each page's last-modified date
   (sitemap, `llms-full.txt`) comes from git.
2. `make workflow-check` lints the workflows with actionlint, and
   `make test-scripts` runs the unit tests for the check scripts below.
   Every step is a make target (`make setup-ci` installs the dependencies);
   `make ci` runs the whole job locally in the same order.
3. `make site-check` builds for production into `public/` once
   (`hugo --minify --gc`, which minifies CSS and JavaScript and leaves HTML
   readable), then checks that output:
   - `make validate-html`: html-validate on every page;
   - `make check-links`: every local link, image, font and `srcset` reference
     resolves ([`check-site-links.py`](../.github/scripts/check-site-links.py));
   - `make check-third-party`: no page, stylesheet or script it loads
     requests anything from another host ([`check-third-party.py`](../.github/scripts/check-third-party.py)),
     because the privacy page promises it. The one exception is the Download
     section's release lookup on `api.github.com` (`assets/js/download.js`),
     which the privacy page discloses; it is the only host besides github.com
     (links) that a script may name;
   - `make check-urls`: every public URL and every anchor the site has
     published still exists
     ([`check-site-contract.py`](../.github/scripts/check-site-contract.py)).
4. `public/` is uploaded as the Pages artifact.
5. On `master` only (a push or a manual run), the `deploy` job publishes that
   artifact with `actions/deploy-pages` under the `github-pages` environment.
   The job needs `pages: write` and `id-token: write`, which it declares itself.

A pull request never deploys. Its run still uploads the built site as the
`github-pages` artifact, which you can download from the run to inspect.

### Verify a deployment

```bash
gh-axi run list -R layer5io/blowhorn-site --workflow site.yml
```

The newest run on `master` should show both jobs green. The deployment is live
at the Pages URL within a minute of the `deploy` job finishing:

- <https://blowhorn.ai/> once DNS points at GitHub Pages (below).
- <https://layer5io.github.io/blowhorn-site/> is the project URL. Because the
  custom domain is already set on Pages, GitHub redirects this URL to
  `https://blowhorn.ai/`, so nothing is reachable there until the DNS records
  below are in place. The artifact itself deploys fine either way.

## Pages configuration

Pages is configured to publish from GitHub Actions (`build_type: workflow`),
not from a branch. The one-time setup, done with an account that administers
the repository:

```bash
gh-axi api -X POST repos/layer5io/blowhorn-site/pages --field build_type=workflow
# or, if Pages already exists:
gh-axi api -X PUT repos/layer5io/blowhorn-site/pages --field build_type=workflow
```

This was done on 2026-10-08: Pages exists with `build_type: workflow` and the
custom domain `blowhorn.ai`. HTTPS enforcement is set once GitHub issues the
certificate, which needs the DNS records below.

`static/CNAME` (published as `/CNAME`) carries `blowhorn.ai` for completeness. With a workflow
deployment GitHub ignores the file; the custom domain is the one set through
the API or Settings > Pages, below.

## Custom domain: blowhorn.ai (the apex)

The site is published under **blowhorn.ai**. `www.blowhorn.ai` is optional:
when its record also points at GitHub, Pages redirects it to the apex.

blowhorn.ai is registered at Porkbun and its DNS is served by Cloudflare. Only
the domain's owner can change records. Today the apex resolves to Cloudflare's
proxy addresses and answers HTTP 526: the record is proxied, so GitHub cannot
verify the origin or issue a certificate. Those records are what the ones
below replace.

### Step 1: the apex records (do this first)

Pick one of the two forms. Either way the record is **DNS only** (grey cloud):
keep the Cloudflare proxy off at least until GitHub has issued the certificate,
because the proxy hides the origin from GitHub's certificate check.

Form A, a flattened CNAME (Cloudflare resolves it to GitHub's addresses itself):

| Type | Name | Target | Proxy |
|---|---|---|---|
| CNAME | `@` | `layer5io.github.io` | DNS only |

Form B, GitHub Pages' fixed addresses:

| Type | Name | Value |
|---|---|---|
| A | `@` | `185.199.108.153` |
| A | `@` | `185.199.109.153` |
| A | `@` | `185.199.110.153` |
| A | `@` | `185.199.111.153` |
| AAAA | `@` | `2606:50c0:8000::153` |
| AAAA | `@` | `2606:50c0:8001::153` |
| AAAA | `@` | `2606:50c0:8002::153` |
| AAAA | `@` | `2606:50c0:8003::153` |

Wait until the apex resolves to GitHub:

```bash
dig +short A blowhorn.ai        # expect the four 185.199.* addresses
dig +short AAAA blowhorn.ai     # expect the four 2606:50c0:* addresses
```

The Pages custom domain is already `blowhorn.ai`. Confirm it, watch the
certificate, and enforce HTTPS once GitHub reports it issued (Settings > Pages
shows "Enforce HTTPS" as available):

```bash
gh-axi api repos/layer5io/blowhorn-site/pages --jq '.cname, .https_certificate.state'
printf '{"https_enforced":true}' | gh-axi api -X PUT repos/layer5io/blowhorn-site/pages --input -
```

If the custom domain ever has to be set again:

```bash
gh-axi api -X PUT repos/layer5io/blowhorn-site/pages --field cname=blowhorn.ai
```

Certificate issuance usually takes a few minutes and can take up to a day. If
it stalls, the usual cause is the Cloudflare proxy being on for the record.

### Step 2: the www record (optional)

| Type | Name | Target | Proxy |
|---|---|---|---|
| CNAME | `www` | `layer5io.github.io` | DNS only |

With `blowhorn.ai` as the Pages custom domain and this record in place, GitHub
answers `www.blowhorn.ai` with a redirect to `https://blowhorn.ai/`.

```bash
dig +short CNAME www.blowhorn.ai   # expect: layer5io.github.io.
curl -sI https://www.blowhorn.ai   # expect 301 to https://blowhorn.ai/
```

## URLs

Every page and asset reference is root-relative (`/css/site.<hash>.css`,
`/assets/brand/...`), built from `baseURL` in [`hugo.toml`](../hugo.toml)
(`https://blowhorn.ai/`). That is what lets `404.html` work for any missing
path, nested ones included. A build with a different base URL
(`make build-production BASE_URL=...` or `make build-preview`) prefixes every
reference with that URL's path. The project URL
`layer5io.github.io/blowhorn-site/` redirects to blowhorn.ai, so nothing is
served under that path in production.

The public URLs are a contract, checked by `make site-check`:

- `/`, and the Trust Center: `/legal/`, `/legal/privacy/` and `/legal/terms/`
  (`content/en/legal/`), with Markdown copies at `/legal/index.md`,
  `/legal/privacy/index.md` and `/legal/terms/index.md`.
- The old `/privacy.html` and `/terms.html` redirect to their `/legal/` pages.
  GitHub Pages cannot send a server redirect, so each is a Hugo alias page (the
  pages' `aliases:` front matter, rendered by `layouts/alias.html`): a meta refresh
  plus a canonical link to the new URL. `/privacy.md` and `/terms.md` are
  static notes pointing at the new Markdown copies.
- The home page's anchors: `#platforms`, `#how`, `#trust`, `#download`.
- The onboarding page `/welcome/` (opened by the Chrome extension on install,
  `layouts/onboarding.html`), and the short paths `/download/`, `/install/`,
  `/signup/`, `/login/` and `/early-access/`, each a meta refresh rendered by
  `layouts/redirect.html`. `/signup/`, `/login/` and `/early-access/` go to
  Layer5 Cloud (no early-access form: anyone without a plan starts the beta
  there), whose URL is `params.cloud_url` in `hugo.toml` alone. None of these
  is listed in `sitemap.xml` or `llms.txt`.
- `/assets/brand/...` (from `static/assets/brand/`), `/favicon.ico`, `/CNAME`.
- Generated: `/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt` (which names the sitemap),
  `/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt` and `/index.md`.

The canonical URLs, Open Graph tags, `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` name
`https://blowhorn.ai/`. A build with `HUGO_PREVIEW=true` marks every page
`noindex, nofollow` and its `robots.txt` disallows everything.

Docsy's own static files (Font Awesome webfonts, its favicons and a few
scripts) are published too because Docsy is imported as a module, as in
layer5io/docs; no page loads them.

## Local checks and evidence

```bash
make setup         # once: npm install
make check         # production build, html-validate, link, third-party and contract checks, check-script tests, actionlint: what CI runs
make site          # http://localhost:1313 with live reload
```

## Product docs sync

The user docs under `/docs/` live in the private product repository
(`leecalcote/blowhorn`, `docs/{tutorials,how-to,reference,explanation}`
and `docs/README.md`) and are mirrored into `content/en/docs/` by
[`sync-docs.yml`](../.github/workflows/sync-docs.yml). The private
repository runs no moderate or heavy Actions of its own, so the work runs
here, on the public site repository.

1. The workflow checks out the product repository at the requested ref
   (a tag, branch or SHA; `master` by default) read-only with the existing
   `DMG_SOURCE_TOKEN` secret (no new secret), the way `publish-dmg.yml`
   handles it, then runs `make docs-sync REF=...`, which is
   [`.github/scripts/sync-docs.py`](../.github/scripts/sync-docs.py)
   (tested by `make test-scripts`). The script copies the four public
   sections and rewrites each page for the site: relative `.md` links
   become root-relative site URLs, `reference/cli.md` becomes the
   `reference/cli/` section index, a missing title is derived from the
   first H1, aliases colliding with a published URL are dropped, and
   headings whose auto id would not begin with a letter get an explicit
   `{#anchor}`. `docs/internal/`, `docs/gtm/` and any path listed in the
   product's `internal-paths.txt` (when it exists) are never copied.
2. `docs/README.md` maps onto the site-owned docs landing
   (`content/en/docs/_index.md`): the landing stays as designed and no
   page is written for the README, whose index role the landing cards and
   the Docsy sidebar already serve. Site-owned `_index.md` landings with
   no product counterpart are likewise kept; every other synced page is
   the product's file converted. Pages carrying `draft: true` stay
   unpublished until the product ungates them.
3. The workflow commits the result signed off (DCO) to the `docs-sync`
   branch (`make docs-sync-base` builds it on the open sync PR's head, or
   afresh on `master` when none is open, so a branch left by a merged PR
   is replaced), opens or updates the one `docs: sync from <ref>` pull
   request, and starts the normal site checks on it itself
   (`make docs-sync-start-checks`, which runs
   `gh workflow run site.yml --ref docs-sync` via `workflow_dispatch`):
   pushes and pull requests made with `github.token` never start
   `pull_request` or `push` workflows, so `site.yml` would otherwise stay
   silent on the sync PR, while a `workflow_dispatch` run started with that
   same token is allowed and attaches to the branch head, showing as the
   PR's check. Merging the PR once those checks pass deploys. The workflow
   never pushes to `master`.

When a synced page breaks a check, fix the converter or the site-side
rendering it drives (`layouts/alias.html`, `layouts/_markup/`,
`hugo.toml` markup settings), never the product docs: the next sync
would overwrite a product-side edit anyway. A product-doc defect the
converter cannot fix (a link outside the published tree, a reference to
the private repository) goes in the sync pull request's description, to
be fixed upstream and re-synced.

Run the same flow locally from a product checkout at `./product`
(or pass `SOURCE_DIR` for a checkout elsewhere):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:leecalcote/blowhorn.git product
make docs-sync REF=master   # or a tag, branch or SHA
make check                  # what the sync pull request runs
```

Before a visual change ships, build for production and serve `public/`, then
take screenshots at 390, 820 and 1440 px wide in both colour schemes and
confirm there is no horizontal scroll from 320 to 1440 px. With
chrome-devtools-axi:

```bash
make build-production && python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory public
chrome-devtools-axi open http://localhost:8080/
chrome-devtools-axi resize 390 844
chrome-devtools-axi emulate --color-scheme dark
chrome-devtools-axi screenshot /path/to/evidence/home-390-dark.png --full-page
chrome-devtools-axi eval 'document.documentElement.scrollWidth > document.documentElement.clientWidth'   # must be false
```

## Internal section (Hugo segments)

`content/en/internal/` is the internal section. Hugo segments in `hugo.toml`
keep it out of the public site:

- `public`: every page except `/internal` and `/internal/**`.
- `internal`: only `/internal` and `/internal/**`.
- `all`: every page. Used by the internal build.

Builds:

| Build | Command | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public (default, what blowhorn.ai deploys) | `hugo` or `make build-production` | `public/`, no `/internal/` |
| Internal (public pages plus `/internal/`) | `make build-internal STRATEGY_SOURCE=path/to/leecalcote/blowhorn` | `public-internal/` |
| Internal preview server | `make site-internal STRATEGY_SOURCE=path/to/leecalcote/blowhorn` | memory, http://localhost:1313/internal/ |

`hugo.toml` sets `renderSegments = ["public"]`; `config/internal/hugo.toml`
sets `renderSegments = ["all"]`. The internal section's `_index.md` cascades
`build: {list: never}`, so its pages stay out of section lists, menus, the
search index, llms.txt and related lists even in the internal build, and out
of the sitemap.

The internal content is never committed here: this repository is public.
It lives in the private leecalcote/blowhorn repository under
`marketing/strategy/hugo/` (plus `marketing/strategy/finance/` and
`docs/capability-comparison/compare-assistants.csv`).
`.github/scripts/fetch-internal.sh`, run by `make build-internal`, copies it
into `content/en/internal/` (gitignored, except the placeholder `_index.md`)
before `hugo --environment internal`. The internal build runs in
leecalcote/blowhorn's `internal-site.yml` workflow and is uploaded there as a
private artifact; it never runs in this repository's Actions, whose artifacts
and logs are public. `docs-sync` only copies the product's `docs/` tree and
already skips `docs/internal/`, `docs/gtm/` and `internal-paths.txt`.

`make check-no-internal` (part of `make site-check`, and a step in `site.yml`)
fails when `public/internal` exists, a public page links to `/internal/` or names an internal file, or git tracks anything under `content/en/internal/` other than `_index.md`.

Footguns:

- A `--renderSegments` flag on the command line overrides the config.
  `hugo --renderSegments all` publishes the internal section.
- `hugo server` honours `renderSegments`, but without `--renderToMemory` it
  also writes to `public/` and serves stale files from there. An internal
  server run that way leaves `/internal/` pages in `public/`. Preview the
  internal site with `make site-internal STRATEGY_SOURCE=...` (it passes
  `--renderToMemory`); `make site` stays public only.
- A segment name that is not defined renders nothing, with no error. A typo
  in `renderSegments` gives an empty site, not a public one.
- `renderSegments = ["public", "internal"]` does not render `/internal/` in
  Hugo 0.158: the `public` segment's excludes win. Use `all`.
- This repository is public. Segments keep pages out of the built site, not
  out of the source. Never `git add -f` anything under `content/en/internal/`.
